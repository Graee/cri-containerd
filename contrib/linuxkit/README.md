# LinuxKit Kubernetes project

The LinuxKit [`projects/kubernetes`](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/tree/master/projects/kubernetes) subdirectory contains a project to build master and worker node virtual machines. When built with `KUBE_RUNTIME=cri-containerd` then these images will use `cri-containerd` as their execution backend.

See the [project README](https://github.com/linuxkit/linuxkit/blob/master/projects/kubernetes/README.md).
